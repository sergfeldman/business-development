**Ethcon Korea 2023 Sponsorship** 

I am proposing a strategic combination of options for Ethcon Korea 2023 sponsorship to maximize our global exposure and make the most of this opportunity. 

Ethcon Korea which is held between Sep. 1-3 is a significant event as it marks the first Ethcon event in Korea since the COVID-19 pandemic, and it is closely followed by KBW 2023, taking place from Sep. 4-10. Given these circumstances, we anticipate a large turnout of global participants at Ethcon Korea. 
Moreover, the sponsorship cost for this event is relatively competitive compared to other similar events. For instance, the minimum cost of ETH Denver 2023 Sponsorship was $15,000.

Considering that Ethcon Korea will be Ubiquity's inaugural offline presence, it is crucial for us to utilize our resources effectively and increase our global exposure within the developer community. 
In light of these objectives, I propose a combination of the following options: a booth (Option 1), Branded T-shirts (Option 3), and 3 models (Option 4).

This strategic combination will not only provide us with a physical presence at the event through the booth but also enhance our visibility with the Branded T-shirts, which will be worn by event attendees. 
Additionally, having 3 models representing our brand will create a strong visual impact and further increase our exposure among the attendees.
By choosing this combination of options, we will be able to maximize our resources and effectively promote our presence at Ethcon Korea, resulting in increased global exposure for the development pool.
